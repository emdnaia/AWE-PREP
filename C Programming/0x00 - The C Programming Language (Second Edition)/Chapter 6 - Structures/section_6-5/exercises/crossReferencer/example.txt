Theres not much you could do or say to phase me
People think Im a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles even occasionaly
Doc Drezyll have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldnt know how to take me
If they heard some shit Id lay the tape fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
like Im goin too fast cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when Im pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates Ill be cool beside JayZ
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
Im thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And Im thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You aint gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake G
Youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit youve been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now dont pussy out and try to wimp out face me
Cause Ive been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I end up
Oh its never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I end up
Oh oh its never enough
My flows untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it
My spot my talk it blaze a direct hit
Graze it your peace talk save it
Your shit sounds dated youre overrated
Im obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If Im the best and the worst then Gods gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy you payin attention boy
I spit shit slick shit so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug press play you aint gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over but you gotta cop it
When its hot its hot
Your hatin is undeniable stop it
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MCs I end up
Oh its never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
