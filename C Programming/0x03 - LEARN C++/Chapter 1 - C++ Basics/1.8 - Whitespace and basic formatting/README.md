# Whitespace and basic formatting

This section was pretty straight-forward and I knew most of it but I did learn about some best practices.

- Consider keeping your lines to 80 chars or less in length.
- When working in an existing project, be consistent with whatever style has already been adopted.
- Using the automatic formatting feature(s) of chosen editor is highly recommended to keep your codeâ€™s formatting style consistent.
