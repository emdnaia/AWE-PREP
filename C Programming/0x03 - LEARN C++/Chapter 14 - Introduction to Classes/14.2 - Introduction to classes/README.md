## Question #1

Given some set of values (ages, address numbers, etcâ€¦), we might want to know what the minimum and maximum values are in that set. Since the minimum and maximum values are related, we can organize them in a struct, like so:

```cpp
struct minMax
{
    int min; // holds the minimum value seen so far
    int max; // holds the maximum value seen so far
};
```

However, as written, this struct has an unspecified class invariant. What is the invariant?

Not sure what is being asked but I would say:

```cpp
class MinMax
{
public:
    int m_min = {};
    int m_max = {}; 
}
```

AH my bad so the answer was: The invariant is that min <= max. If min is ever greater than max, any code that uses this struct may malfunction.
