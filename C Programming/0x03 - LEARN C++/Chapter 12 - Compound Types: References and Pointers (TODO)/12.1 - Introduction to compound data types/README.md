C++ supports a set of data types called compound data types. We can see the supported compund types below:

- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointer types
  - Pointer to object
  - Pointer to function
- Pointer to member types
  - Pointer to data member
  - Pointer to member function
- Reference types
  - L-value references
  - R-value references
- Enumerated types
  - Unscoped enumerations
  - Scoped enumerations
- Class types
  - Structs
  - Classes
  - Unions

For example `std::string` is actually a class type!
