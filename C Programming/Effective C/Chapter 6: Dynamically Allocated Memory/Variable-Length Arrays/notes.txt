/* FUNCTION PROTOTYPE SCOPE */

You can also declare VLA's as function parameters. For example, the n parameter
in the signature for memset:

```
void *memset(void *s, int c, sizt_t n);
```

When you call such a function, n should accurately represent the size of the array
referenced by s. Undefined behavior results if this size is larger than the array.

When declaring a function to take a VLA as an argument that specifies a size, we
must declare the size of the array before referencing the size in the array
declaration. We could, for example modify the signature for the memset function
as follows to take a VLA:

```
void *memset_via(size_t n, char s[n], int c);
```
