Microsoft created the C11 Annex K functions to help retrofit its legacy
code base. These functions were then proposed to the C standards committee
for standardization, published as ISO/IEC TR 24731-1 (ISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2007),
and later incorporated into C11 as a set of optional extensions. Despite the
improved usability and security provided by these functions, they aren't yet
widely implemented at the time of this books writing.
